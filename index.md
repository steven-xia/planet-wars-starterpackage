Planet Wars Starter Package
===========================

Note: This challenge has been over for almost a decade; why are you still looking at it?

This repository contains a round-up of all you need to start the 2010 Google AI Challenge Planet Wars (hereinafter 
Planet Wars Challenge) originally run by the University of Waterloo.

Getting Started
---------------

Under `starterbots/` are slimmed down versions of the official starter packages for C++, C#, Java and Python.

Pick your language of choice and copy the contents to the root folder.
What you have is a bot with a very basic strategy.
Look at the file `MyBot.*` (different file extensions depending on programming language) to understand the basic 
strategy of the bot and how communication with the game engine works.

For how the game works, look at the 
[official specifications](https://steven-xia.github.io/planet-wars-starterpackage/specification) of the game.

### Playing Games

Included in this starter package are two game playing scripts.

*  `play.py` for playing an individual game from a randomly generated map and viewing it.
*  `play_multiple.py` for playing multiple games on multiple randomly generated maps.
